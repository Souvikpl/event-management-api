# event-management-api# Event Management API

This is a clean, compile-ready NestJS project using Express (v4), Mongoose v7 and Multer.

## Quick start

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. env file:
   ```bash
   .env
   ```

3. Ensure MongoDB is running (localhost or update MONGO_URI).

4. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run start:dev
   ```

The app serves uploads from `/uploads` (public) and runs on `http://localhost:4000` by default.
